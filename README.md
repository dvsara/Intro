A passionate web development student from Italy. I like to explore the unknown to conquer new frontiers. I am imaginative, inventive and I'm just getting started. I'm open minded to new technologies. I'm a hard worker, committed and self learner. Definitely, I'm not a guru jedi rockstar ninja, but I always get my stuff done. When I'm not busy working on various projects, you'll find me on a theatre stage or volunteering.

From choreography on a stage to lines of code on a web page, I love combining the worlds of logic and creative design to make eye-catching, clean, responsive, accessible, and user-friendly websites and applications. I am analitycal andmethodical and I am passionate about coding and solving problems through code. I have a practical knowledge of website interfaces, cross-browser compatibility, and web standards. I'm open to good communication and collaboration with other people. For Now, I'm fully comfortable with some of the tools used in the industry and I'm seeking to learn Angular and React frameworks soon.
